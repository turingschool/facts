### Turing School FAQs
All of your Turing WTFs can be found here. If it's not, shoot us a pull request and we'll try to answer it!

## Q. What is a cohort/module?
The cohort is the people that you take classes with. The module is the collection of classes. There are four modules. In the first one you learn Ruby, in the second you learn Rails and Sinatra, in the third and fourth you build on these skills.

## Q. What is a posse?
A posse is a group you are placed in that consists of students across all cohorts. You'll meet with other Turing students in your posse for 30 min. every morning to do warm-up exercises, and they can be a great resource for project help. Your slack channel will also have Turing alumni from your posse in it, and you can ask them for mentoring/pairing help.<br />
[If you are curious about who the posses are names after, you can read about it here.](posse-namesakes.md)

## Q. What is a mentor? How do I get one?
A mentor is someone that has either graduated from Turing or has a connection another way. They have expressed a willingness to pair with you on projects, exercisms or just general questions in order to supplement your class time. You can either get a mentor by reaching out to Mary Cutrali, the mentor wrangler at Turing, through your posse slack channel or from reaching out directly to someone on the [mentor spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VU9hYwBdCZOHehyjis6Rx01RFpC9aDUj-zisNRQjL94/edit#gid=411918470).

## Q. What is pairing?
Pairing is when you work with a partner on one set of code. You can have two people work on one laptop, plug your laptop into one of the big screens with two keyboards and both work at the same time, or work via [screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) or another screensharing app.

## Q. Why pair?
Sometimes two heads are better than one.

## Q. So, I can plug into those big screens in the work space?
Yes, go for it. They are available for anyone to use.

## Q. What is exercism?
[Excercism](http://exercism.io/) is a site where you can practice your Ruby (or other languages) with  coding exercises. When you think you're done, post your answer to the site and other users will give you feedback on how you can improve. Pairing on exercism can be a great activity to do with a mentor.

##Q. Why do some people have cool terminal set-ups? How do I get one?
Your terminal set-up is a very personal thing. If someone has a set up you like, ask them how they got it and they can probably help you. Some of the options you might want to consider: personalizing your color scheme, adding SiB, MrSpec and Fish, whether you want to use Atom or Vim, etc...

##Q. How do I "pass" a module?
In module 1, in addition to submitting and defending your portfolio you must receive 3s or higher on your pairing project (Headcount) and on your [assessment] (http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/assessments/scrabble.html).

##Q. What is a portfolio and how do I make one?
A portfolio is a summary of your individual, team and community accomplishments during a module. You must submit one to the [turing github repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) and defend it in order to move on to the next module.

##Q. What is an assesment?
An assessment is when you sit down with one of the staff at the end of the module and they pair with you on a small project for 30 minutes.

##Q. What happens on Fridays?
On Fridays you'll get together with your cohort and do a "group retro" where you review what has happened for the week and discuss the highs and lows. Then we'll have a guest speaker, lightning talks and student led sessions for the rest of the day. You might have a "one on one" with a staff member, where you get to individually discuss your experiences at Turing.

##Q. What's a lightning talk? What is a student led session?
In modules 2-4 you'll be asked to give a 15min talk on something programming(ish) related. This is to prepare you for speaking in pubic. If a student wants to expand on a topic for more than 15 min then they can lead a session in the late afternoon.

##Q. What are Pry and Seeing is Believing?
Pry and Seeing is Believing(SiB) are Ruby troubleshooting tools that will be invaluable to you. Learn how to use them as soon as possible!

##Q. I'm the last one here! What do I do?
Turn off the lights are make sure all the doors are closed and locked.

##Q. Does Turing have a library?
It does. It's over by the staff desks by the sofa.

##Q. What is DSA?
It stands for Data Structure and Algorithms. It's an optional after school extracurricular workshop series focusing on computer science topics. Most people don't start attending this until module 2, although you are welcome to attend whenever you want.

##Q. Does Turing have any clubs?
Lots! There is the Joan Clarke Society for anyone who identifies as female and the LGBT club for anyone who identifies as LGBT or as a friend of the LGBT society. There's a bunch more too! If you would like to join any of these, just find them on slack!

##Q. What's in all those cubbies? Can I put things in those cubbies? Can I take things from them?
Do it, grab a cubby. Anywhere you want. You can keep all your stuff in it. There are also cubbies in Classroom A that you can take stuff from: T-shirts, Headache Medicine, Art Supplies, Lost and Found - they are all labeled. Just don't take anything from anyone's personal cubby :)

##Q. I need caffine. Can I make coffee?
Please do!

##Q. How long can I keep my food in the fridge?
The fridge gets cleaned out every Monday.

##Q. Who cleans this place?
You do! Replace paper towels and toilet paper when they run out, put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher, put keyboards and cords away when you are done and don't leave garbage lying around. And every couple of months your posse will be asked to do a little extra (take out trash and wipe down tables) after school.
